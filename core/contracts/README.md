## Current Contracts

- `CaptureEventContracts.swift`: `RawEvent`, `ContextSnapshot`, `NormalizedEvent`.
- `KnowledgeTaskContracts.swift`: `TaskChunk`, `TaskBoundaryReason`, `TaskSlicingPolicy`.
- `KnowledgeItemContracts.swift`: `KnowledgeItem`, `KnowledgeStep`, `KnowledgeContext`, `KnowledgeConstraint`, `KnowledgeSource`.
- `OrchestratorContracts.swift`: `OpenStaffMode`, `ModeTransitionContext`, `ModeTransitionDecision`, `OrchestratorLogEntry`.
